## How to view these notes

While looking at the individual files, you might have noticed that sometimes, the images won't look right, there will be different tags, etc. That is because I use obsidian.md which is great tool for taking down notes. If you want to see these notes properly, then I suggest using it. I am fully aware that it is built in electron. But worry not, it is very optimized and snappy.

Here is the graph in case you are curious.
