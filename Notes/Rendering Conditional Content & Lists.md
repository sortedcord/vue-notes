# Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering refers to showing content based on some certain condition.

For this, vue has a directive called `v-if`.

```html
<p v-if="goals.length === 0">Length is 0</p>
```
Other directives such as `v-else` and `v-else-if` also work in the same way.

### `v-show`

`v-show` is another alternative to `v-if` which has the same functionality as that of the if statement however, it doesn't work with the else and else-if directives.

The main difference is that with v-show the entire html element is not rendered at all. That means you wouldn't find it in the HTML document when viewing the webpage's source code. However, with v-show, a 'display:none' style property is added. So that means that it is in the HTML document and its rendered but its just not visible. 

You should use only use `v-show` to an element whose visibility changes a lot.

# Rendering Lists of data

In order to render lists of data and outputting repeated content, you can use the `v-for` directive.
