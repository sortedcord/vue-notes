 ## Objective
 
 The objective is to output the desired course goal inside of the paragraph tag using vue which could potentially be changed dynamically.
 
 #### Creating a Vue App
 
 First step would be to create a vue app. But now we can store it inside of a constant like so-
 
 ```js
 const app = Vue.createApp();
 ```
 
#### Establishing Connection

And now we have to let vue know which part of the HTML section should be controlled by it. Since the section `user-goal` will be manipulated, we will use the `mount` #Methods on the `app` #object.
 
 `mount` method required a string which holds a _CSS Selector_ which uniquely identifies the element in our DOM. 
 
 ```js
 app.mount('#user-goal');
 ```
 
 We can now use Vue features to manipulate this section by passing an #object to create app. This can be used to configure the various options of this app.
 
 One option that we can set is the `data` option and it requires a function as a value. This data function returns an #object.
 
 ```js
 data() {
 	return {
	};
 }
 ```
 
 In this returned object we can now set up any key value pairs with any key of your choice.
 
 Anything that's part of the returned object can now be used in the vue controlled HTML part.
