# Eploring Vue Alternatives
While vuejs is a #component-based UI #framework, it does include all the core features. However, it is a bit less popular than React and Angular.

## React.js

#React is an alternative to vue. It's also a #javascript #framework, though officially, its a #library because it has less features than vue. It only focuses on redering UIs and misses some features like #routing.

However these features can be added via #community-packages. 

## Angular.js

#Angular is another alternative #framework. It has more features than vue and is popular with enterprise solutions. It uses #TypeScript (Vue can also be used with #TypeScript) which can be overkill for smaller projects.
