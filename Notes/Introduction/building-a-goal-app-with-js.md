# Building an app with JS

[Directory Tree of the App](../../Project%20Files/5.1%20gs-01-starting-project/)


```
Root folder
|
|-app.js
|-index.html
|-styles.css
```

`index.html` is the basic markup of the application.

`styles.css` is where the styling of our app is stored in.

`app.js` is where the Js code will go to fetch the user input when the button is clicked, create a new list item, and that to the list of items.

## Functionality

This is a basic application, that takes the input from the user and displays it as a "goal" in a list.

* First the user enters some data in the text field and clicks the button
* Js listens to the click event, takes the data entered in the text field and appends to the list.

Next we will try to [[Rebuilding a goal app with vuejs]] and see why Vue.js can be more convinient a better aproach than vanilla.js.
