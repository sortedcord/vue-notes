# Building an app with JS

[Directory Tree of the App](../../Project%20Files/5.1%20gs-01-starting-project/)

|-app.js
|-index.html
|-styles.css
```

`index.html` is the basic markup of the application.

`styles.css` is where the styling of our app is stored in.

`app.js` is where the Js code will go to fetch the user input when the button is clicked, create a new list item, and that to the list of items.
