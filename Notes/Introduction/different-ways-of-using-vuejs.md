# Different Ways of Using Vue.js

*   ## Widget approach on a multi-page application.
    
    Vue can be used to control parts of HTML pages and make it a bit more interactive.
    For example, have a chat overlay or a sidebar which loads elements dynamically.

    Some pages are still rendered and served by a backend server.

*   ## (SPA) Single-page Application approach

    Another approah of using vue.js would be to code the entire front-end in vue.js so every element is rendered and controlled by vue.js.

    In this case, the server sends only one HTML file, thereafter, vue takes over and controls the UI.
