# Seting Up Course Developement Environment

This is a personal developer environment that I really like to use. In case you want your development environment to be the same as the of the instructor check this section instead.

### IDE

For IDE I use **Visual Studio Code**. Now, the reson why I don't opt for Code-OSS or similiar is because firstly, im lazy. Vscode comes with all of the plugins and settings sync right out of the box and I don't have to configure it to get all of the plugins that I use on a day-to-day basis. 

**Theme**: Synthwave '84'

**Plugins for vue**

* Git Lens - Version Control
* Vue 3 Snippets - Intellisense
* Syntax Highlighting for Vue
* Tabnine - Intellisense
* Live Server
* Prettier - code formatter
