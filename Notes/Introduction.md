# Introduction

## What is vue.js

Vue.js is a _javascript_ _framework_ that makes building interactive and _reactive_ _web frontends_ easier. 

`Javascript` is a programming language that is supported by all modern browsers. It allows you to manipulate what the user sees on the screen without fetching new page from the server.

`Framework` is a third party library which exposes utility and functionality such as methods and tools (Which you don't have to write on your own). Unlike a regular library a framework is a library which also gives you a set of rules, i.e a clear approach that you should follow while writing your application.

`Reactive` means that your app is able to react to user's input, update the screen. Such as to show overlays or input validation errors, etc.

`Web Frontends` means what the user sees. It's basically the how you app looks like. It is not a server side framework. Helps in providing a rich user interface in the web.

## Why use Vue.js

Traditionally, in a web app, you click a link and wait for a new page to lead. You click a button and wait for some action to complete. And this happens again and again. Like submitting a form. Hence, in a traditional webpage, we wait for responses all the time.

Javascript, can help us speed things up. It allows us to create a more modern webapp as it has the advantage of running on the loaded page. Which means that we can use this to change that page, without fetching new html. We can manipulate the HTML structure (Document Object Model) of a page with Javascript. So in modern webapps, we don't send requests again and again, instead, we do this once and thereafter we just exchange data behind the scenes and use client side javascript and its frameworks (Like vue.js) to update what's on the screen.

### Why Vanilla.js might not be ideal for all kinds of apps

In an ideal world, no frameowrk such as vue.js is needed but in such a case 

* we would have to write all of the code and logic on our own and reinvent the wheel all over again
* This makes our code vulnerable to unoptimization, errors and bugs. We may also face security and performance issues. 
* Collaboration might be harder as not everyone might understand our code structure and philosophy of our code.

This is why we use `Vue.js` as it gives us a clear rule set in which everyone has to work. With vue.js we don't have to focus on the small details, instead we can focus on our _core business logic_ with vue and let it do the work of updating the page, etc.
